# Welcome to Project 7 Review

For this project we were assigned to access "GitHub" so that we could become more familiar with it for ourselves and for future references such as projects and grades.


# Learning Objectives:
- gaining more experience working with GitHub repos
- gaining experience working with GitHub Pages

## Main TakeAway/Interest From this Project:

- My main interest was the fact that it sent me back to the aspect of html which is a part of IT I love the most!
